My first proper website - a recipes website. 

I feel like I'm stumbling in the dark a bit here but it is interetsing how this coding/web developing thing works. Hopefully by the end of this project I will have some basic understanding of how to build a basic website.
I like Brutalist webdesign, I should try and implement that in this project. 
CONSISTENCY IS KEY. Keep plugging away.
